## This is my toy robot challenge

I am still working on this so don't be too harsh!

## Get the app running

Open a terminal in the backend folder

- Run 'npm i'
- Run 'node src/server.js'

Open a terminal in the client folder

- Run 'npm i'
- Run 'npm start'

The browser should open in http://localhost:3000/

## Start moving the robot

In the node terminal start typing any of these commands:

- move
- left
- right

The terminal will tell you your current position

To see the robot move look in the browser!
